Whitespace = whitespace is ignored within both expressions and statements
and is basicly the "WHITE space"

Indentation = Pyhton requiers consistency in whitespace indentation 
and if the previous statment uses indentation the others also REQUIRE it

Continuation = When the lines are long you can press "enter" and continue the same line
below. This is indicated by using ("/") or ("\")

Keywords = They indicate commands to the Python
interpreter. Such keywords as this : 
(" and, del, from, not, while, as,elif, global,
 or, with, assert, else, if, pass, yield, 
break, except, import, print, class, exec,
in, raise, continue, finally, is, return, def, for
lambda, try, true, false, none")

Operators = They are special tokens (sequences of
characters) that have meaning to the pyhthon
interpeter. ("+, -, *, **, /, //, %, <<, >>, &
|, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, <>, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=,
%=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=, **= ") (vantar tvö)

Punctuators and Delimiters = Punctuators, also known
as Delimiters, separate different elements in
Python statements and expressions (" (, ), [, ],
, , :, ., ', =, ;, ', ", #, {, @, \ ")

Literals = Is a value that cannot be changed in
the program. for example 123 is a literal, it 
has a fixed value and cannot modified.

Variables = A variable is a name you create
in your program to represent "something"
in your program. That "something" can be
many types of entities: a value, another program,
a set of data or a file.

what the "=" means in pyhton = In math "=" means
equality whereas the left side and right side
are equal but in python "=" means assignment. 
Assigment is the operation to associate a value 
witha variable.

my_var = 4

my_var = my_var + 1

NOW my_var = 5

Integers = ("int") It's type corresponds to our
mathmatical notion of integer. f.x. + (addition),
- (subtraction), *(multiplication) etc.

Floating-point numbers = Floating-point or
real numbers are designated in python as type 
float. The floating-point type refers to non-
integer numbers, numbers with decimal points.
2,99x10^8 is written 2.99e8

Boolean = The boolean type refers to the values
true or false and can only be either of those
two things

String = ("str") A string is a collection type.
A collection type contains multiple objects 
organized as a single object type.

List = A list is like a string but i can have
different elements other than characters in the 
squence

In python when you suptract two integer numbers
you will get a floating point result. to combat 
this you can either use // or %.

My_int += 2         my_int = my_int +2
My_int -= 2         my_int = my_int -2

Algorithm: A method-a sequence of steps-that
decripes how to solve a problem or class of
problems
